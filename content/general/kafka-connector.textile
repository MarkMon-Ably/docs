Use the Ably Kafka Connector to send data from one or more "Kafka topics":https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/apache-kafka/topics/ into an Ably channel.

If you need to send data from Ably to Kafka instead, use a "Kafka rule":/general/firehose/kafka-rule.

This feature is currently in Preview.

h2(#install). Install the connector

The Ably Kafka Connector is available to install from "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/kafka-connect-ably or "Confluent Hub":https://www.confluent.io/hub/ably/kafka-connect-ably.

View detailed instructions for installation on "GitHub":https://github.com/ably/kafka-connect-ably#install.

h2(#configure). Configure the connector

Configure the connector to set "properties":https://github.com/ably/kafka-connect-ably#configure such as which Kafka topics to send data from, and which Ably channel should receive the data. 

Note that the configuration method will differ depending on whether you are running a single or distributed set of "connect workers":https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/self-managed/userguide.html#configuring-and-running-workers.
