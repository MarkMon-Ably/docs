Integrations enable data to be sent from Ably to external services and for external services to send data to Ably channels.

Ably events can be used to trigger webhook requests to external services such as "IFTTT":https://ifttt.com/ and "Zapier":https://zapier.com/ or invoke functions such as "Amazon Lambda functions":https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/. Ably events can also be streamed to external streaming and queuing services such as "Amazon Kinesis":https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/ and "Amazon SQS":https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/.

Data can be sent from an external service into Ably channels. Configure an "incoming webhook":#incoming-webhooks in Ably to use in an external service, or use the "Ably Kafka Connector":/ to stream data from Kafka into Ably to distribute messages to client devices. 

h2(#webhooks). Events via webhooks

Events within Ably can be used to trigger webhook requests to external services. 

"Event":/general/events sources include "messages":/realtime/messages published to a channel, "presence events":/realtime/presence, "channel creation and closure":/realtime/channels#channel-lifecycle and changes in "channel occupancy":/realtime/inband-occupancy#occupancy-events.

Events can be used to trigger requests for: 

* "HTTP callbacks":/general/events
* "IFTTT":/general/events/ifttt
* "Zapier":/general/events/zapier

Events can also be used to invoke:

* "Amazon Lambda functions":/general/events/aws-lambda
* "Azure functions":/general/events/azure
* "Cloudflare Workers":/general/events/cloudflare
* "Google Cloud functions":/general/events/google-functions

h3(). Incoming webhooks

"Incoming webhooks":/general/incoming-webhooks enable you to publish data from an external web service into an Ably channel. Register a new webhook endpoint and configure it within an external service to publish the data to an Ably channel. 

h2(#streaming). Continuous streaming

Stream Ably events to an external streaming or queuing service, or use Ably to distribute messages from a service such as Kafka to client devices.

h3(). Inbound streaming

Inbound streaming options are where an external service streams data to Ably.

The "Kafka Connector":/general/kafka-connector extends Kafka's streaming capabilities beyond your private network by enabling you to distribute messages to client devices.

h3(). Outbound streaming

Outbound streaming options are where Ably events are streamed to an external streaming or queuing service. 

"Event":/general/events sources include "messages":/realtime/messages published to a channel, "presence events":/realtime/presence, "channel creation and closure":/realtime/channels#channel-lifecycle and changes in "channel occupancy":/realtime/inband-occupancy#occupancy-events.

The services available to stream to are:

* "AMQP":/general/firehose/amqp-rule
* "Amazon Kinesis":/general/firehose/kinesis-rule
* "Amazon SQS":/general/firehose/sqs-rule
* "Kafka":/general/firehose/kafka-rule
* "Pulsar":/general/firehose/pulsar-rule
