Incoming webhooks provide a way to integrate external web services with Ably. The incoming webhooks are routed to Ably channels as "messages":/realtime/messages.

Many web services generate webhooks as a way of communicating with your web application. These web services often generate webhooks based on interaction with their APIs and infrastructure. To allow Ably to receive these webhooks you need to configure the external web service with a webhook URL. The webhook URL specifies the endpoint for the generated webhook requests, and is defined from within the Ably "dashboard":https://www.ably.com/dashboard. 

You can configure the external web service with an Ably URL and webhook requests are invoked on that endpoint. The webhook data is sent to the configured Ably channel as a message.

Ably also supports "outgoing webhooks":/general/events. These are webhooks that can be generated by Ably to integrate Ably with other services such as "Zapier":/general/events/zapier/.

h2(#configure). Configuring your incoming webhook

You configure your incoming webhooks in the @Settings@ tab of the Ably "dashboard":https://www.ably.com/dashboard:

1. In the @Incoming Webhooks Setup@ section, click the @Register a new webhook endpoint@ button.
2. Give your webhook a friendly name.
3. Specify a new or existing Ably channel which is going to receive the incoming webhooks.
4. Click the @Generate a URL@ button.
5. Copy the generated webhook URL to the clipboard, and use it to configure your service as required.

You can optionally test your webhook is correctly configured using the Curl requests provided in the "dashboard":https://www.ably.com/dashboard.

h2(#test). Test your incoming webhook

You can now optionally test your incoming webhook with a Curl command such as the following:

```[sh]
curl -X POST 'https://rest.ably.io/channels/webhook-test/messages?key={{API_KEY_NAME}}:{{API_KEY_SECRET}}&enveloped=false' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"some":"json"}'
```

Ably responds with the @channel@ and @messageId@ of the message that results from the inbound webhook: 

```[json]
{
	"channel": "webhook-test",
	"messageId": "4RcVBJsAbC:0"
}
```

h2(#receive). Receiving the incoming webhook

You can receive the incoming webhook as you would a normal Ably message on a channel. For example, if the incoming webhook data is in JSON format, you can display the data using the following code:

```[nodejs]
var ably = new require("ably").Realtime('{{API_KEY_NAME}}:{{API_KEY_SECRET}}');

/* Obtain the channel that has been configured to receive webhooks */
var channel = ably.channels.get('webhook-test');

/* Incoming webhook messages can be displayed using this function */
channel.subscribe(function(message) {
    console.log("webhook: " + JSON.stringify(message.data));
});
```

h2(#headers). Specifying optional headers

The request body of incoming webhooks is treated as a message to be published. You can optionally set headers and parameters in your external service, if the service supports this, as described in the "REST API":/rest-api#unenveloped documentation.

The following example shows how the message name could be set via a request header:

```[sh]
curl -X POST 'https://rest.ably.io/channels/webhook-test/messages?key=key:secret&enveloped=false' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"some":"json"}' \
     -H 'X-Ably-Name: webhook-message'
```

Your code to receive the named message is:

```[nodejs]
channel.subscribe('webhook-message', function(message) {
    console.log("webhook: " + JSON.stringify(message.data));
});
```

h2(#summary). Summary

Ably's incoming webhooks support allows you to configure external services to work with Ably. The incoming webhooks are generated as messages on the configured Ably channel, where they can be processed by your application as required.
