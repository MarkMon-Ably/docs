h2(#overview). Overview

The Control API is a REST API that allows you to manage your Ably account remotely.

Using this API you can manage:

* Your applications
* Keys for an application
* Namespaces
* Queues
* Rules

h2(#authentication). Authentication

In the Ably dashboard, on the top menu bar, navigate to "Free account" (other account name as appropriate) and select "My Access Tokens" from the menu.  

You are presented with the "My Access Tokens" area, where you can create tokens for use with the Control API. 

h3(#create-access-token). Create an access token

To create a new token use the following procedure:

1. Click the "Create new access token" button. 
2. Enter a friendly name for your token, so you'll remember what it's used for.
3. Select the capabilities you wish the token to have, depending on your use case.
4. Click the "Create" button to create the token.

h3(#using-access-token). Using the access token

From the "My access tokens" area you can click the "Copy Token" button, to copy the button to the clipboard.

You use the access token to validate your API requests. This is done by using the access token as a bearer token in the @Authorization@ of the HTTP request. For example, using Curl:

```[sh]
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' ...
```

h2(#ids). Account and application IDs

Note that some requests require your Account ID, and some require your App ID.

h3(#account-id). How to find your Account ID

In the Ably dashboard, on the top menu bar, navigate to "Free account" (other account name as appropriate) and select "Account settings". Your Account is displayed.

h3(#app-id). How to find your Application ID

In the Ably dashboard click on the app you want to find the application ID for. Click on the "Settings" tab. The App ID is displayed under "Application settings".

h2(#examples). Examples

h3(#list-apps). List your apps

To list all the apps associated with an account:

```[sh]
curl "https://control.ably.net/v1/accounts/<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>/apps" \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
