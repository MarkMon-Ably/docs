You can use a Kafka rule if you want to pass data from Ably to Kafka. "Data sources":/general/firehose#data-sources such as messages, occupancy, lifecycle and presence can be configured to generate data that is passed to Kafka.

If you want to pass data from Kafka to Ably, you can use the "Ably Kafka Connector":https://github.com/ably/kafka-connect-ably, rather than Kafka rules.
