WebHooks allow your server to be notified over HTTP about channel lifecycle events (such as channel creation) and presence events (such as members entering or leaving).

Typically if a customer wants to receive events in real time, then we recommend that the "Ably Realtime client libraries":/realtime are used to subscribe to realtime events. However, some customers prefer to be notified over HTTP when significant events occur such as a user joining a channel and thus triggering the creation of a channel, or members entering or leaving channels.

In order to prevent overloading your servers with requests, Ably batches WebHook data and issues a @POST@ request with @JSON@ data in the body of the request to your servers. WebHook requests are typically published no more than once per second per configured WebHook.

See the "realtime channel lifecycle documentation":/realtime/channels-messages#channels to better understand how channels are created and when they are discarded.

See the "realtime presence documentation":/realtime/presence to better understand what presence events are supported on channels, all of which you can subscribe to via WebHooks.

You can configure WebHooks in your "account dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048664-how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard on a per app basis.

"Get in touch":https://www.ably.io/contact if you have any questions about WebHooks.

h2. Channel lifecycle events

When a client attaches to a channel, a channel is implicitly created within the global Ably service triggering a @channel.opened@ WebHook event. The channel will remain open for as long as there are any subscribers attached to the channel.  Once all subscribers have left the channel, as part of our garbage collection process, the channel will eventually be closed triggering a @channel.closed@ event.

The following channel lifecycle fields are submitted in WebHooks:

- key := @channel.opened@ or @channel.closed@
- name := the channel name
- site := the datacenter associated with the channel master

h2. Presence events

When a member enters, updates, or leaves a channel, a presence WebHook event is triggered.

For every presence event published via WebHooks, the "PresenceMessage":/realtime/types#presence-message object is sent in JSON format.

h2. Configuration

WebHooks are configured in your "account dashboard":https://support.ably.io/solution/articles/3000048664-how-do-i-access-my-account-dashboard. The following fields are available for each configured WebHook:

- url := The URL of your server where the WebHook JSON data is posted
- custom headers := Allows you to provide a set of headers that will be included in all HTTP POST requests
- events := Allows you to select either @Channel Lifecycle@ or @Presence@ events
- sign with key := If you would like us to sign the data before HTTP posting it your servers so that you can verify the authenticity of the WebHook data, we will sign the data using the selected private key
