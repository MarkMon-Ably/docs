Limits are applied to all accounts in order to prevent any impact on service caused by deliberate or accidental abuse. Limits vary depending on the "package":https://ably.com/pricing you are signed up to and the effect of hitting or exceeding a limit varies depending on the type of limit. Enterprise package limits are customizable.

h2(#overview). Overview

The majority of limits fall into one of three categories depending on how the resource is limited when hit: "instantaneous rate limits":#instantaneous-rates, "account restrictions":#restrictions or "account blocks":#blocks. Limits are also local or global depending on whether they effect the whole platform or just a part of it: 

- Local limits := apply to a local part of the platform, such as an individual channel or connection. Examples of local limits include the maximum number of channels per connection and the maximum publish rate on a channel. Email notifications are not sent for local limits.
- Global limits := apply to limits that effect your whole account, such as peak connections. Global limits are an aggregate of usage across all applications in your account. Email notification warnings will be sent when a global limit is close to being reached, or has been hit.

h3(#instantaneous-rates). Instantaneous rate limits

Instantaneous rate limits are based on the rate of an operation per second. If the limit is exceeded then the operation will be suppressed. 

Rate suppression is calculated on a rolling probabilistic basis. For example, the limit on a self-service package for publishing messages into a queue is 100 messages per second. If a queue rule is attempting to publish 200 message per second into the queue, each message will have a 50% chance of being rejected. The suppression probability is continuously updated based on the publishing rate.

Instantaneous rate limits only have a hard limit. Once the hard limit rate has been exceeded then message suppression will occur. As soon as the rate drops below the hard limit threshold, the suppression probability will decrease to zero.

h3(#restrictions). Account restrictions

Account restrictions prevent the creation of additional resources for the limit that was hit. All other operations can continue.

For example, if the peak connection hard limit is hit then no more connections can be made to Ably until some of the existing ones disconnect and the total is back below the hard limit. If an hourly hard limit is hit, such as the number of API requests, then no more API requests can be made until the following hour. 

Limits that can result in an account restriction have a soft limit and a hard limit. "Quota limits":#quota use the pre-paid quota as the soft limit. A restriction doesn't come into effect until the hard limit is hit. Usage above the soft limit for self-service and business account quota limits are charged as overages. Limits unrelated to quota limits, such as token requests, can still experience an account restriction, however any usage over the soft limit is not chargeable. 

Account restrictions are lifted automatically once the resource is brought below the hard limit. For connections this means disconnecting unnecessary connections and for channels, detaching from any channels not in use. Hourly-based account restrictions such as API requests are automatically lifted the following hour. 

h3(#blocks). Account block

An account block only occurs when the hourly or monthly message hard limits are exceeded. An account block prevents any further usage on the account for the period of the block. A block period can be for an hour or for the remainder of the current month, depending on which limit was hit.

Account blocks are lifted automatically if an account package is upgraded to one with more messages. 

h2(#quota). Quota limits

Quotas are based on the account "package":https://ably.com/pricing/calculator that you are on. Quotas specify the number of peak channels, peak connections, messages and bandwidth that you expect to consume each month. Self-service and business accounts can configure their monthly quotas, whereas free account quotas are static and enterprise account quotas are designed to be unreachable.

The quotas for an account can be considered a soft limit, with any "account blocks":#blocks or "account restrictions":#restrictions coming into effect when the hard limit is reached. Free accounts have a small buffer between the soft and hard limits. Self-service and business accounts have a considerably larger buffer between soft and hard limits, however any usage over the soft limit and up to the hard limit is charged as overages.

h3(#peak-connections). Peak connections

Peak connections are the maximum number of realtime clients connected to Ably simultaneously at any point within a month. 

For example, if you have 10,000 customers and at the busiest time of the month 500 connect to Ably at the same time, then your peak connections figure is 500.

Exceeding the peak connections hard limit will result in an "account restriction":#restrictions on new connections.

h3(#peak-channels). Peak channels

Peak channels are the maximum number of channels that are open simultaneously at any point within a month. 

For example, if you have 10,000 customers and at the busiest time of the month 500 users each attach to 1 unique channel and 1 common channel, then your peak channel figure is 501. Alternatively, if at the busiest time of the month 2,000 users are evenly split between 50 channels, with 40 users in each, then your peak channel figure is 50.

A channel is considered open when a message is published on the channel using the REST API, or a realtime client attaches to the channel. The channel will remain active for as long as the client is attached to the channel unless they explicitly detach from the channel or close their connection.

An open channel will automatically close when there are no realtime clients attached to it and approximately one minute has passed since the last realtime client detached, or since a message was published on the channel.

Exceeding the peak channels hard limit will result in an "account restriction":#restrictions on channel creation.

h3(#messages). Messages

Message counts and rates are the number of "messages":/glossary#messages published and received in your account per second, per hour and in total for a month. 

* The total messages for a month are set based on your quota. 
* The hourly message rate is calculated using the total message limit divided by 72.
* The per second message rate is calculated using the hourly message rate multiplied by 2.5, divided into seconds.

If the per second message rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to message delivery and publishing. Exceeding the hourly or total message hard limit will result in an "account block":#blocks for the remainder of the hour or month respectively.

h3(#bandwidth). Bandwidth

Bandwidth is the amount of data transferred through "messages":/glossary#messages per second, per hour and in total for a month. 

* The total bandwidth is calculated using the average message size of 2KiB multiplied by the total message count. 
* The hourly bandwidth rate is calculated using the total bandwidth limit divided by 72.
* The per second bandwidth rate is calculated using the hourly bandwidth limit multiplied by 2.5, divided into seconds.

If the per second bandwidth hard limit is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to message delivery and publishing. Exceeding the hourly or total bandwidth hard limit will result in an "account block":#blocks for the remainder of the hour or month respectively.

h2(#token). Token request limits

Token request limits relate to the rate and size of "token requests":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication made to Ably.

|_/2=. Limit |_\2=. Free |_\2=. Self-service |_\2=. Business |_\2=. Enterprise |
|_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |
| "Token request rate":#token-rate (per hour) | 60,000 | 72,000 | 0.4 * hard limit | "Connection rate":#connection-rate per hour / 1000 | 0.2 * hard limit | "Connection rate":#connection-rate per hour / 1000 |\2. Custom |
| "Token request rate":#token-rate (per second) | - | 50 | - | 0.4 * hourly limit | - | 0.2 * hourly limit |\2. Custom |
| "Token request size":#token-size |\8=. 128KiB |

h3(#token-rate). Token request rate

The token request rate is the maximum number of token requests that can be made to Ably per second and per hour.

If the per second token request rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to token requests. Exceeding the hourly token request hard limit will result in an "account restriction":#restrictions on token requests.

h3(#token-size). Token request size

The token request size is the maximum size of a signed token request that will be accepted by the Ably platform.

h2(#connection). Connection limits

Connection limits relate to the "realtime connections":/realtime/connection to Ably from your account.

|_=. Limit |_=. Free |_=. Self-service |_=. Business |_=. Enterprise |
| "Connection rate":#connection-rate (per second) | 20 | >=50 | >=50 | Custom |
| "Number of channels":#connection-channels (per connection) | 50 | 200 | 200 | Custom |
| "Outbound message rate":#outbound-message (per second) | 15 | 50 | 50 | Custom |
| "Inbound message rate":#inbound-message (per second) | 15 | 50 | 50 | Custom |
| "Connection state recovery":#connection-state |\4=. 2 minutes |

h3(#connection-rate). Connection rate

The connection rate is the number of new "realtime connections":/realtime/connection that can be made to Ably per second.

The limit is calculated based on the hard limit for "peak connections":#peak-connections, with a minimum value of 50 per second for self-service and business accounts.

If the connection rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to new connection attempts.

h3(#connection-channels). Number of channels

The number of channels per connection are the number of channels each client can be attached to on a "realtime connection":/realtime/connection.

If a connection attempts to exceed the limit on the number of channels it is attached to, the attachment will fail and the error code @90010@ will be returned.

h3(#outbound-message). Outbound message rate

The outbound message rate is the maximum number of messages that can be published per second on a "realtime connection":/realtime/connection.

h3(#inbound-message). Inbound message rate

The inbound message rate is the maximum number of messages that can be received per second on a "realtime connection":/realtime/connection.

h3(#connection-state). Connection state recovery

Connection state recovery is the duration the Ably service will keep a connection alive for if the client connection drops. This accounts for scenarios such as where a client is switching between WiFi and 4G, or entering a tunnel. If the client reestablishes its connection within the allowed duration, all messages and presence events will be replayed to them in order.

If a connection isn't reestablished in time, the client is detached from its channels and the error code @80008@ is returned.

h2(#channel). Channel limits

Channel limits relate to the number, rate and membership of "channels":/glossary#channels on your account.

|_=. Limit |_=. Free |_=. Self-service |_=. Business |_=. Enterprise |
| "Number of subscribers":#subscribers (per channel) |\4=. Unlimited |
| "Presence members":#presence-members (per channel) | 50 | 200 | 200 | Custom |
| "Channel creation rate":#channel-create (per second) | 20 | >=50 | >=50 | Custom |
| "Message publish rate":#message-publish-rate (per channel) | 15 | 50 | 50 | Custom |

h3(#subscribers). Number of subscribers

There is no limit on the number of clients that can be subscribed to a channel.

h3(#presence-members). Presence members

The number of clients that can use the "presence feature":/realtime/presence in a channel is limited as a precaution. If a large number of clients are subscribed to presence events on a channel then the amount of messages can scale very quickly.

As an example, consider 200 clients subscribed to presence events on a channel and all of them join and leave the presence set within a few minutes. This would result in the following messages:

* 200 presence messages published for the enter event.
* 200 x 200 (40,000) messages subscribed to for the enter events.
* 200 presence messages published for the leave event.
* 200 x 200 (40,000) presence messages subscribed to for the leave event.

This highlights the potential for 80,400 messages to be sent in a very short space of time on a single channel.

Any clients that attempt to join the presence set over the presence member limit will be rejected and the error code @91003@ will be returned.

h3(#channel-create). Channel creation rate

The channel creation rate is the number of channels that can be created per second.

The limit is calculated based on the hard limit for "peak channels":#peak-channels, with a minimum value of 50 per second for self-service and business accounts.

If the channel creation rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to channel creation.

h3(#message-publish-rate). Message publish rate

The message rate is the maximum rate at which messages can be published on a channel.

If the message publish rate is exceeded for a channel, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates on publishing will be applied to that channel.

h2(#message). Message limits

Message limits relate to the number, rate and bandwidth of "messages":/realtime/messages on your account.

|_=. Limit |_=. Free |_=. Self-service |_=. Business |_=. Enterprise |
| "Message size":#message-size (KiB) | 16 | 64 | 64 | 256 |
| "History TTL":#history-ttl (hours) | 24 | 72 | 72 | Custom |

h3(#message-size). Message size

The message size is the maximum size of a single published "message":/glossary#messages.

Note that the average message size is set to 2KiB. Although a message can be published that is 16KiB, this will count as 8 messages towards your "message count":#messages.

Attempting to publish a message in excess of the message size limit will fail and thd the error code @40009@ will be returned.

h3(#history-ttl). History TTL

History time to live (TTL) is the maximum time that a message or presence event can be retrieved from "history":/realtime/history.

h2(#queues). Queue limits

Queue limits relate to the number, length and rates of "queues":/glossary#queues.

|_=. Limit |_=. Free |_=. Self-service |_=. Business |_=. Enterprise |
| "Number of queues":#queue-numbers (per account) | 5 | 50 | 50 | Custom |
| "Queue length":#queue-length (per account) | 10,000 | 50,000 | 50,000 | Custom |
| "Queue publish rate":queue-publish (per second) | 100 | 200 | 200 | Custom |
| "Queue TTL":#queue-ttl (hours) | 1 | 24 | 24 | Custom |

h3(#queue-numbers). Number of queues

The number of queues is the maximum number of queues that can be created. This limit includes all applications in your account.

h3(#queue-length). Queue length

Queue length is the maximum number of messages that can be stored in queues whilst waiting to be consumed. This value is shared between all queues on the account.

For example, with a free account you could have one queue with a length of 10,000 messages, or two queues each with a length of 5,000 messages.

h3(#queue-publish). Queue publish rate

The queue publish rate is the maximum rate that messages can be published to a queue at, per second.

If the queue publish rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates on publishing to queues is applied.

h3(#queue-ttl). Queue TTL

Queue time to live (TTL) is the time that a message is stored in a queue for. If the message is not consumed before this time then it is transferred to the "dead letter queue":/glossary#dead-letter.

h2(#integration). Integration limits

Integration limits relate to the rate of "events":/general/events and the rate of messages streamed through "Reactor Firehose":/general/firehose.

|_=. Limit |_=. Free |_=. Self-service |_=. Business |_=. Enterprise |
| "Webhook batch size":#webhook-batch | 50 | 100 | 100 | Custom |
| "Webhook batch concurrency":#webhook-concurrency | 1 | 1 | 1 | Custom |
| "Firehose message rate":#firehose-messages (per second) | - | - | - | Custom |
| "Function invocation rate":#function-invocations (per second) | 15 | 30 | 30 | Custom |
| "Function concurrency":#concurrent-functions (per second) | 30 | 60 | 60 | Custom | 

h3(#webhook-batch). Webhook batch size

The limit on webhook batch size is the maximum number of webhook events that can be sent per batch.

h3(#webhook-concurrency). Webhook batch concurrency

Webhook batch concurrency is the number of webhook batches that can be processed simultaneously.

h3(#firehose-messages). Firehose message rate

The Firehose message rate is the maximum amount of firehose messages that can be streamed per second.

If the Firehose message rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates on publishing to Firehose.

h3(#function-invocations). Function invocation rate

The function invocation rate is the maximum number of functions that can be invoked per second.

If the function invocation rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates on function invocations is applied.

h3(#concurrent-functions). Function concurrency

Function concurrency is the maximum number of functions that can run at the same time. This rate only applies to Google Cloud functions and Azure functions. AWS Lambda functions do not count towards this rate as they use the asynchronous @event@ invocation type.

h2(#api). API request limits

API request limits are the maximum number of REST API requests that can be made to Ably per second and per hour. This excludes "token requests":#token.

|_/2=. Limit |_\2=. Free |_\2=. Self-service |_\2=. Business |_\2=. Enterprise |
|_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |_. Soft |_. Hard |
| API request rate (per hour) | 4,200 | 5,000 | 0.1 * hourly message soft limit | 0.1 * hourly message hard limit| 0.1 * hourly message soft limit | 0.1 * hourly message hard limit |\2. Custom |
| API request rate (per second) | - | 20 | - | >=50 | - | >=50 |\2. Custom |

If the per second API request rate is exceeded, an "instantaneous rate limit":#instantaneous-rates will be applied to API requests. Exceeding the hourly API request hard limit will result in an "account restriction":#restrictions on token requests.
