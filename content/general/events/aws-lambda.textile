As part of "Reactor Events":/general/events, it is possible to integrate with various systems.

"AWS Lambda Functions":https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ provide event-driven serverless compute functions which allow users to easily run code whenever events are sent to it. These can be very useful for integrating into various other AWS systems.

h2(#tutorials). Tutorials

If you would like to just dive in and see an example of this being implemented, then take a look at our "AWS Lambda tutorial":/tutorials/reactor-event-aws.

For more details on the specifics of how Reactor Events and our integrations work, check out our "Reactor Events documentation":/general/events.

h2(#fields). Rule fields

- AWS Region := The region you chose for your "AWS Lambda function":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#lambda_region.
- Function Name := The name you gave your "AWS Lambda function":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html.
- AWS Authentication Scheme := the "authentication scheme":#aws-auth-scheme you use for your function. Either @AWS Credentials@ or @ARN of an assumable role@. See the Ably "AWS authentication":/general/aws-authentication/ documentation.
- Qualifier := optional qualifier for your AWS Lambda function.
- "Source":/general/events#sources := Choose which of @Message@, @Presence@, @Channel Lifecycle@, or @Channel Occupancy@ events on channels should activate this Event Rule.
- "Channel filter":/general/events/#channel-filter := An optional filter on channel name, to restrict the channels the rule applies to. Use a regular expression to match multiple channels.

h2(#restrictions). Restrictions

At present, it is not possible to "batch":/general/event#batching messages to AWS Lambda Functions, nor can messages be "encoded":/general/events#encoding in anything besides JSON.
