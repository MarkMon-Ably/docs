Ably can deliver native push notifications to iOS devices using "Apple’s Push Notification service":https://developer.apple.com/notifications/. Native push notifications, unlike Ably’s channel based pub/sub messaging, do not require the device to maintain a connection to Ably as the underlying platform or OS is responsible for maintaining its own battery efficient transport to receive push notifications. Therefore, native push notifications are commonly used to display visual notifications to users or launch a background process for an app in a battery efficient manner.

In this tutorial, we'll see how you can setup and send push notifications to iOS your app using the "Ably Push Notification service":/general/push. You will also learn how to test this integration by sending notifications to an iOS device.

Ably supports two types of client permissions for access to the Push Notification service:

* @push-subscribe@: A client with this permission is a push target device, and it can manage its registration and any subscription for itself. However, it won't be able to manage push registrations or channel subscriptions for any other device.
* @push-admin@: A client with this contain permission has full access to the "Push admin API":https://www.ably.io/documentation/general/push/admin, and can manage registrations and subscriptions for all devices.

Read more about permissions (also called capabilities) in our "API documentation":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained.

By default, the Push Notification service provides the @AblyRealtime.push.activate@ method for the device to register itself with Ably directly, but you can instead delegate the device registration and subscription to your server. For this tutorial we are going to register directly using the device. You can jump to "another tutorial":/tutorials/ios-push-tutorial-server-registration if you'd rather like to have a server a device with Ably.
