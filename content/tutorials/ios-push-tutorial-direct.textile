title: iOS Push Tutorial - Direct Registration
section: tutorials
index: 69
---

This tutorial will walk you through how to add push notifications to your app using the Ably <a href="https://www.ably.io/documentation/general/push">push</a> service. You will also learn how to test this integration by sending notifications to an iOS device.

Ably supports two types of push mechanism:

* @push-subscribe@: Register new devices, deregister them, and subscribe and unsubscribe them to channels for push notifications.
* @push-admin@: Register, update and deregister any device registration, and subscribe and unsubscribe to channels for push notifications. Publish push notification using the @POST /push/publish@ endpoint (@AblyRealtime.push.admin.publish@ method).

Typically, client devices subscribing for push will either have @push-subscribe@ privileges or "delegate operations to a server":#activation-from-server with @push-admin@ privileges.

The default for AblyRealtime.push.activate is to register the device with Ably directly from the device, but you can instead delegate that to your server. For this tutorial we are going to register directly using the device.
