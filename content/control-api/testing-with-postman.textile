There are several ways you can try out the Control API. You can use a command line tool such as "Curl":https://curl.se/ or "HTTPie":https://httpie.io/ to test out various requests. Another way is to use a graphical tool such as Postman or Paw. This topic looks at testing with Postman.

h2(#importing). Importing the OAS3 document into Postman

A convenient way to try out the REST APIs is by importing the OAS3 document into "Postman":https://www.postman.com/. To do this, carry out the following steps: 

1. Make sure you have "Postman":https://www.postman.com/downloads/ installed.

2. Start Postman and select File > Import from the main menu. The import dialog is displayed:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/postman-import.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/postman-import.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Postman import dialog">
</a>

3. Drag and drop the OAS3 document you want to test, or use the "Upload file" button to select and import an OAS3 document. Alternatively, if you haven't already downloaded the document, you can provide a link to it in the Ably OpenAPI documents "GitHub repository":https://github.com/ably/open-specs/definitions/control-v1.yaml.

4. In the Import dialog use the default settings and click "Import".

5. The imported document will now appear in your Postman collections:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/imported-collection.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/imported-collection.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Postman imported collection">
</a>

You are now ready to test out the API.

h2(#send-request). Sending a request

You have now imported the OAS3 document into Postman. You now need to "configure a token":#authentication to authenticate any requests you make to the Control API.

For many Control API requests you will also need to specify your Account ID or Application ID. You can see the "documentation":/control-api#ids for details on how to obtain these.

Now that you understand where to obtain these items, you will learn how to create and execute a request in Postman. 

1. The following screenshot shows the required parameters for the "List account apps" request:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/app-list-request.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/app-list-request.png" style="width: 100%" alt="App list request">
</a>

This is an account-level operation and therefore requires your Account ID in the `account_id` request parameter.

2. You also need to configure your token as a `Bearer Token` in the Authorization tab:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/bearer-token.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/bearer-token.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Bearer token">
</a>

If you don't supply this token your request will fail to authenticate.

3. Now that everything is configured, you can send the request:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/send-request.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/send-request.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Send request">
</a>

4. The server returns a response:

<a href="/images/screenshots/control-api/response.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/control-api/response.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Response">
</a>

You can also use the command-line tool "Curl":https://curl.se/ to work with the Control API. Some Curl examples are provided "here":/control-api/curl-examples.
