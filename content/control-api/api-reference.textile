h2(#overview). Overview

The Control API is a REST API that allows you to manage your Ably account remotely.

The OAS specification for this API can be found in the Ably Open Specs "GitHub repository":https://github.com/ably/open-specs.

h2(#Versioning). Versioning

Each specification contains a version number. If a change is made that is breaking (that is, not backwards compatible) Ably will create a new specification file. For example, Control API version one is in @control-v1.yaml@, but version two would be in @control-v2.yaml@. Currently, only the latest version of the API is rendered here. However, if you want to view a rendering of an older version of the API specification, please visit the Ably Open Specifications "GitHub repository":https://github.com/ably/open-specs for information on how to do this.
