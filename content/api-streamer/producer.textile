A Producer of data uses API Streamer to share live data streams with subscribers. Examples of realtime data streams include live sports scores, positioning updates for transport and logistics, or live data streamed from IoT sensors. These data streams can easily be published to the API Streamer, where they can be shared with "data consumers":api-streamer/consumer. 

You can use the API Streamer to deploy, manage and distribute your data streams hosted using your DSN apps.

h2(#deploy). Deploy

Built on our globally-distributed, serverless Data Stream Network, the API Streamer lets you reliably deploy your streaming APIs. Issues typically encountered when deploying realtime APIs such as scalability, bursts of usage, uptime guarantees, message ordering and data integrity, are all taken care of.

h2(#manage). Manage

Use API Streamer’s realtime native API Management toolkit to maximize the value of your realtime APIs. Streamer’s developer portal gives you security, analytics, stream transformation, as well as monetization and billing tools. Streamer helps turn data streams into revenue streams.

h2(#distribute). Distribute

API Streamer is designed for ease of publishing, eliminating the need for custom-built integrations. You can simply publish realtime data to the platform with end-to-end delivery guarantees. Whether your data reaches one or a million subscribers, engineering effort is minimal.

To understand the end-to-end delivery-ness of the API Streamer, consider the scenario below:

TODO IMAGE
You have your data - > Publish it into DSN (thus making it available as an api) -> Let your clients use this data or => let other companies use this data by making it available via the API Streamer.
