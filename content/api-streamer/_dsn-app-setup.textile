h2. Setting up a DSN app

If you don't have an account with Ably, you can "sign up":https://www.ably.io/signup for a free account as you will need an "Ably API key":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030502-setting-up-and-managing-api-keys and access to the dashboard to manage the app. Once you have an Ably account:

# "Log into your app dashboard":https://support.ably.io/support/solutions/articles/3000030053-how-do-i-access-my-app-dashboard
# Under "Your apps", choose the app you wish to use, or create a new one with the "Create New App" button
# Click on the "API Keys" tab
# Copy the secret "API Key" value from your Root key, or create a new one with "specific capabilities only":/core-features/authentication#capabilities-explained and store it so that you can use it later
