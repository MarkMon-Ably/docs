h2(#publishing-data-with-api-streamer). Managing your data streams with Ably's API Streamer

Ably's Data Stream Network (DSN) lets you create any number of applications using which you can stream data in realtime to various clients of your application. Using the API Streamer, you can share the data streams in your DSN applications with developer teams of other organizations, with clear and easy to use Realtime API management features such as consolidated stats and analytics, list view of all the consumers of your streams, rate limits and such.

If you already have a DSN app, you can skip to learning about the various elements of the API Streamer and how to set those up.

When using the API Streamer, you can publish your realtime data by being a producer or subscribe to a stream of data by being a consumer, or you can produce data and subscribe to your own stream, thus playing both roles.

h3(#producer). Being a producer

The producers of data, as the name suggests are the data providers that have the relevant data that is to be published in realtime to the interested clients. As mentioned before, all of the data to be published is done using a DSN app. However, to enable other developer teams to use your data streams, you'll need to set up a producer profile on the API Streamer dashboard and create one or more products which enable these data streams to be shared with developer teams. You can jump to the producer documentation to learn more about being a producer.

h3(#consumer). Being a consumer

Consuming data streams is very straightforward. To consume a data stream, you'll need to be invited by the producer of data.
