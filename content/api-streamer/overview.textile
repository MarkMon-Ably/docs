h2(#what-is-api-streamer). What is API Streamer?

API Streamer makes it easy and cost-effective to expose data feeds and create realtime APIs. It combines Ably's Data Stream Network with realtime API management tools to provide the first unified platform for managing the full lifecycle of realtime APIs - from deployment to distribution.

Typically today, data producers provide rate-limited REST APIs for developers to consume data from. But increasingly those APIs are failing to meet developer performance expectations, as polling a REST API offers substandard latencies. So data producers are creating realtime APIs to meet developer demand for realtime data.

However, creating realtime APIs without a realtime API management platform in place to maintain and manage those APIs leads to higher complexity, cost and pressure on the engineering teams to implement these crucial features from scratch.

This is the gap that API Streamer fills: ready-built API management tools and a distribution network for creators of realtime APIs.

h2(#publishing-data-with-api-streamer). Managing your data streams with Ably's API Streamer

Ably's Data Stream Network (DSN) lets you create any number of applications using which you can stream data in realtime to various clients of your application. Using the API Streamer, you can share the data streams in your DSN applications with developer teams of other organizations, with clear and easy to use Realtime API management features such as consolidated stats and analytics, list view of all the consumers of your streams, rate limits and such.

If you already have a DSN app, you can skip to learning about the various elements of the API Streamer and how to set those up.

h2(#api-streamer-elements). Understanding the elements of the API Streamer

When using the API Streamer, you can publish your realtime data by being a producer or subscribe to a stream of data by being a consumer, or you can produce data and subscribe to your own stream, thus playing both roles.

h3(#producer). Being a producer

A producer of data uses API Streamer to share live data streams with subscribers. Examples of realtime data streams include live sports scores, positioning updates for transport and logistics, or live data streamed from IoT sensors. These data streams can easily be published to the API Streamer, where they can be shared with "data consumers":#consumer.

h3(#consumer). Being a consumer

A consumer is usually invited to API Streamer by a producer so the consumer can subscribe to, manage, and consume the data streams.
