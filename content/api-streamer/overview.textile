h2(#what-is-api-streamer). What is API Streamer?

"API Streamer":https://www.ably.io/api-streamer makes it easy for developers to publish realtime APIs (also known as event-driven APIs or streaming APIs). Built on <a href="https://www.ably.io/dsn">Ably's global data stream network</a>, API Streamer provides an additional layer of tooling and features for deploying data to the Ably network, managing data streams, and distributing those data streams to developers through realtime push and pull subscription APIs.

h3. How does API Streamer make it easier for developers to publish realtime APIs?

When organizations decide to offer APIs to developers, they typically start by building REST APIs. REST APIs are prolific, in a large part due to standardization allowing organizations to simply communicate with each other, synchronously, following a request/response pattern. To date, REST APIs have served developers well and are largely responsible for the catalyst that drove the API economy to emerge.

However, as organizations are increasingly moving towards event-driven architectures, and need to deliver realtime experiences to their end-users, the need for realtime business-to-business data exchange is rapidly emerging. REST APIs are still mostly being used to solve realtime data sharing requirements in spite of their design not being suitable for streaming data. As a result, REST APIs are frequently being subjected to excessive polling, infrastructure is becoming overloaded, and the latencies for realtime data delivery is high.

Many early adopter organizations are addressing this problem by building their own realtime APIs, typically based on WebSockets, WebHooks or a custom streaming HTTP protocol. What they are finding however is that delivering realtime data at scale, with low latency, across the current and emerging protocols, with the necessary tooling to manage these data flows, is a significant upfront and ongoing engineering undertaking.

This is the problem that API Streamer addresses. Developers can focus on the data that needs to be shared, whilst Ably provides ready-built API management tools, a global low latency and reliable distribution network, protocol interoperability and limitless scale.

h2(#api-streamer-roles). Understanding the API Streamer

Ably's established "global data stream network (DSN)":https://www.ably.io/dsn offers a simple API to developers who publish and receive realtime data using "pub/sub channels":https://www.ably.io/channels. Ably is a serverless messaging platform that offers unparalleled reliability, latency, security and streaming at any scale, globally.

API Streamer is conceptually a management layer, built on top of the DSN, for data producers to share realtime data, over any number of push and pull subscription protocols, with any number of data consumers. Following the pub/sub pattern, API Streamer allows data producers to be decoupled from data subscribers, offloading the engineering complexity of scale, interoperability and distribution to the Ably network. Whilst Ably ensures producers and consumers are technically decoupled, producers retain complete control over their data with API Streamer dashboards, instrumentation, reporting and monetization features.

h3(#producer). The Data Producer

Data producers are typically organizations or developers, and use API Streamer to share their realtime data streams with other developers. Data producers publish their data over channels to the Ably DSN, and based on access control lists, can manage who has access to their data via realtime APIs that API Streamer makes available. For example, a train company may publish live train information to an Ably channel in their account, and using the API streamer, allow developers to subscribe to this data via the Ably platform. Developers may, for example, elect to have this data pushed to them via WebSub, or subscribe to this data directly on their mobile devices.

API Streamer ensures data producers are technically decoupled from data consumers, thus offloading all the engineering complexity required to stream data with realtime APIs.

h3(#consumer). The Data Consumer

Data consumers are typically organizations or developers, who have been given access to one or more data streams, from one or more data producers. The consumer, using their API Streamer dashboard, can chose how they wish to consume these data streams. Ably supports pull subscription protocols like MQTT or SSE, that is a client connects to Ably and subscribes to a data stream. Ably also supports push subscription protocols such as Kafka, AMQP or Amazon SQS/Kinesis, where Ably will pro-actively connect to a third party system push data to that endpoint.
