h2(#what-is-ably-hub). What is Ably Hub? 

The "Ably Hub":https://www.ably.io/hub is part of Ably’s wider "Open Data Streaming Program &#40;ODSP&#41;":https://www.ably.io/blog/ably-open-data-streaming-program/. The ODSP is essentially an initiative designed to ‘democratize’ the realtime data-sharing economy - Ably’s contribution to an "open web":https://www.openapis.org/blog/2019/02/08/ably-realtime-joins-openapi-initiative-to-share-streaming-data-expertise. In real terms, the Hub is an app-store like portal where developers can easily browse, share and subscribe to realtime data streams. 

h2(#ably-hub-working). How does it work?

Under the ODSP, anyone producing streams of data can use the Ably Hub to host and distribute data for free, provided they make it freely available for others, in line with our fair use policy. 

h2(#using-ably-hub). How can I host my streams on Ably Hub?

When creating a product from your "API Streamer Producer dashboard":/api-streamer/producer, you can simply check the Ably Hub box to list your products publicly on the Hub. Anyone can then look at your product, read up the documentation and request a subscription to one or more of your products on the Ably Hub. You can then decide to grant them the subscription or not, just like you would invite any "consumer":/api-streamer/consumer to access your data streams via the "API Streamer":/api-streamer/overview.

More info and a step-by-step guide coming soon...
