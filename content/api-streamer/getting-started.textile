Ably's Data Stream Network (DSN) lets you create any number of applications, using which you can stream data to various clients of your application. Using the API Streamer, you can share the data streams in your DSN applications with developer teams in other organizations as well, with clear and easy to use Realtime API management features such as consolidated stats and analytics, list view of all the consumers of your streams, rate limits and such.

If you are already using the Data Stream Network to stream data to your own clients, you can skip to learning about producers and consumers and how to set those up.
