 Ably's presence feature allows clients or devices to announce their presence on a channel. Other devices or services may then subscribe to these presence events (such as entering, updating their state, or leaving the channel) in real time using our "realtime SDKs":/realtime, or via the "Ably Integrations":https://ably.com/integrations. You can also request a list of clients or devices that are online/offline on a channel at a particular point in time via the "REST API":/rest-api#presence.

 Furthermore, if persistence is enabled on the presence channel, you can also retrieve "presence history":/rest/history#presence-history for the channel, i.e, static data about historical presence states of your clients/devices. This operation also can be done using both Ably's "Realtime":/realtime and "REST":/rest libraries.

h2(#occupancy-presence). Occupancy and presence

"Occupancy":/core-features/occupancy differs from presence in that presence enables a client to identify themselves to other clients subscribed to presence events on a channel, as well as to update their member data for subscribers to view. Presence events are emitted when a client enters or leaves a channel or when they update their member data. Occupancy provides a count of the clients attached to a channel, broken down into specific metric categories. Occupancy data can be viewed at a specific point in time when using the channel status API, or emitted as events when metrics change using a @channel.occupancy@ rule source or inband channel occupancy.
