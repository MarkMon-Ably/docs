We need to install ngrok to expose our local running server to the internet. Follow the instructions on their website <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">here</a> in order to install it.

Once you have it installed run the following command in terminal:

```
$ ngrok http 3000
```

You may find the above command does not work depending upon where you have installed it ngrok. Try this command instead if the above fails:

```
$ ./ngrok http 3000
```

You should see the following (or similar) within terminal:

<a href="/images/tutorials/ngrok-running-example.png" target="_blank">
	 <img src="/images/tutorials/ngrok-running-example.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Ngrok running example">
</a>

This has opened up your localhost port 3000 to the internet and provided you with both a http and https url to reach it.

Note: From this point on you should now use the https url provided by ngrok and replace any existing or future http://localhost:3000 with that.
