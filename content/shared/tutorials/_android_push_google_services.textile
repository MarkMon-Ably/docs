As part of enabling Google APIs or Firebase services in your Android application you may have to add the google-services plugin to your @build.gradle@ file:

```[groovy]
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.2.0'
    // ...
}
```

The google-services plugin has two main functions:

* Process the @google-services.json@ file and produce Android resources that can be used in your application's code.

* Add dependencies for basic libraries required for the services you have enabled. This step requires that the apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' line be at the bottom of your @app/build.gradle@ file so that no dependency collisions are introduced. You can see the result of this step by running `./gradlew :app:dependencies`.
