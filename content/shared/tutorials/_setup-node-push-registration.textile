In this step, we'll setup the device registration and subscription for the Push Notifications to be received for messages sent on the @push@ channel.

Add the following code to your index.js:

```[nodejs]
app.get('/subscribe', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Registering device')
  //will need to inspect the request to see if this works
  var deviceId = req.query.deviceId
  console.log('Device Id ' + deviceId)
  var deviceToken = req.query.deviceToken
  var recipientDetails = {
            transportType: 'apns',
            //replace with actual device token
            deviceToken: deviceToken
  }
    var myDevice = {
      id: deviceId,
      formFactor: 'phone',
      metadata: 'PST',
      platform: 'ios',
      push: {
          recipient: recipientDetails,
          // state: 'Active'
      }
  }
  realtime.push.admin.deviceRegistrations.save(myDevice, (err, device) => {
      if(err){
          console.log('Error: ' + err.message)
          res.status(500).send('Error registering: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
      } else{
          console.log('Device registered:' + device.id)
          subscribeDevice(device)
          res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
	        res.send(device);
      }
  })
})
```

In the above code we use the @save()@ method on the @realtime.push.admin.deviceRegistrations@ to register the device with Ably, using its device ID, that was sent as part of the request. If the registration is successful, we go on to subscribe the device (or client) to the push channel over which we intend to send the required messages. We send the device details back to the client so it knows it was successful and can inform the Ably SDK.

This function is shown below:

//device subscription
function subscribeDevice (device){
  var channelSub = {
      channel: 'push',
      deviceId: device.id
  }
  realtime.push.admin.channelSubscriptions.save(channelSub, (err, channelSub) => {
      if(err){
          console.log('Error: ' + err)
      } else{
          console.log('Device subscribed to push channel with deviceId' + device.id)
      }
  })
}
```

If there's no error thrown, your device is successfully subscribed to the @push@ channel.
