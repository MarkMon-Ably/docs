We'll need to install ngrok to expose our local server to the internet. Follow the instructions on their ngrok's <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">website</a> to install it.

Once you have it installed run the following command in terminal:

```[bash]
$ ngrok http 3000
```

You may find the above command not work, depending upon where you have ngrok installed on your drive. In such a case, try the following command instead:

```[bash]
$ ./ngrok http 3000
```

If everything goes as expected, you should see the following (or similar) within terminal:

	 <img src="/images/tutorials/push-ios/ngrok-running-example.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Ngrok running example">
</a>

It means that ngrok has opened up your localhost port 3000 to the internet and provided you with both a HTTP and HTTPS URLs to reach it.

Note: From this point on, you should use the https URL provided by ngrok and replace any existing or future http://localhost:3000 with that.
