In this step, we'll see how you can enable the correct capabilities required to send Push Notifications to your iOS app.

If you are building a new iOS application, make sure the bundle ID of your app matches with the one that we created in the previous steps. We will be using cocoapods. You can follow the installation instructions from the <a href="https://cocoapods.org">cocoapods homepage.</a>

Open your Podfile and add the following as a dependency:

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'Ably'
```

In your terminal run the following command to install the pod:

```[bash]
$ pod install
```

From this point on, we'll be using the Xcode workspace. Open your target settings and go to the capabilities tab. Scroll down and turn on the Push Notifications capability as shown below.

  <img src="/images/tutorials/push-ios/ios-capabilities-push.png" style="width: 100%" alt="iOS Push Capabilities">
</a>

Now open your @AppDelegate.swift@ file and paste the following code before your class declaration:

```[swift]
import UIKit
import Ably
import UserNotifications

let authURL = "YOUR_NGROK_HTTPS/auth"
let subscribeURL = "YOUR_NGROK_HTTPS/subscribe"
```

Here we have set up an endpoint to the authorization server. You'll need to replace this with your own ngrok provided URL after you have your server up and running. We have also imported the required modules.

Next, we'll register with Ably as follows:

```[swift]
var realtime: ARTRealtime!
var channel: ARTRealtimeChannel!
var subscribed = false
var deviceTokenString: String?
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    DispatchQueue.main.async() {
        print("** didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken")
        self.deviceTokenString = deviceToken.reduce("", {$0 + String(format: "%02X", $1)})
        ARTPush.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken: deviceToken, realtime: self.getAblyRealtime())
    }
}

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
    DispatchQueue.main.async() {
        print("** didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError")
        ARTPush.didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(error, realtime: self.getAblyRealtime())
    }
}
```
The code above contains the standard application handlers that allow you to register for Push Notifications. As you can see, we also notify the Ably platform if the registration was successful or not, so that it can handle registration for us. Further, we have also converted the device token to a string and assigned it to a variable that is shared in the AppDelegate.

Now, we need to authenticate the app with our auth server next, this will allow us to register as a push-admin. In the same file add the following code:

```[swift]
private func getAblyRealtime() -> ARTRealtime {
    let options = ARTClientOptions()
    options.authCallback = { params, callback in
        self.getTokenRequest() { json, error in
            do {
                callback(try ARTTokenRequest.fromJson(json!), nil)
            } catch let error as NSError {
                callback(nil, error)
            }
        }
    }
    realtime = ARTRealtime(options: options)
    realtime.connection.on { state in
        if let state = state {
            switch state.current {
            case .connected:
                print("connected")
            case .failed:
                print("failed")
            default:
                break
            }
        }
    }
    return realtime
}

func getTokenRequest(completion: @escaping (NSDictionary?, Error?) -> ())  {
    let requestURL = URL(string: authURL)!
    let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: requestURL as URL)
    let session = URLSession.shared
    let task = session.dataTask(with: urlRequest) {
        (data, response, error) -> Void in
        let httpResponse = response as! HTTPURLResponse
        let statusCode = httpResponse.statusCode
        if (statusCode == 200) {
            do{
                let json = try JSONSerialization
                    .jsonObject(with: data!, options:.allowFragments) as! NSDictionary
                completion(json, nil)
            } catch {
                print("There was an error while obtaining JSON")
            }
        }
    }
    task.resume()
}
```

In the first function, we have setup our connection to Ably. You can use your API Key here to authenticate with Ably, however, we've used the "Token Authentication":/core-features/authentication#token-authentication strategy as it's more secure. For this, we've request a token from the auth endpoint of our server. The second function is where the bulk of the token request to our server happens. It's a simple GET request and JSONSerialization.

Let's add some error handling to the same class as shown below:

```[swift]
func didDeactivateAblyPush(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
    if let error = error {
        // Handle error
        print("** push de-activation failed", error)
        return
    }
    print("** push de-activated, re-activating")
    self.realtime.push.activate()
}
```

The callback in the above function tells us if we have deactivated push. As there is no reason for us to do that at the moment, we simply reactivate it in such a scenario. 

Next, we'll add a delegate method that tells us if push is activated giving us an opportunity to subscribe to the channels. We will not be handling the subscription here as our server will be responsible for this.

```[swift]
func didActivateAblyPush(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?) {
    if let error = error {
        // Handle error
        print("** push activation failed, err=\(String(describing: error))")
        return
    }
    print("** push activated")
}
```

The @ablyPushCustomRegister()@ method provides us with the device details that we can pass on to our server in order to register the device with Ably and subscribe to channels. We encode and pass the @deviceId@ in this example, however you can pass entire objects if you wish.

```[swift]
func ablyPushCustomRegister(_ error: ARTErrorInfo?, deviceDetails: ARTDeviceDetails?, callback: @escaping (ARTDeviceIdentityTokenDetails?, ARTErrorInfo?) -> Void) {
  if error != nil {
    // Handle error
    print ("** failed to custom register: \(String(describing: error))")
  }

  let request = NSMutableURLRequest(url: NSURL(string: "\(subscribeURL)?deviceId=\(deviceDetails?.id ?? "")&deviceToken=\(deviceTokenString ?? "")")! as URL,
                                cachePolicy: .useProtocolCachePolicy,
                                timeoutInterval: 10.0)
  request.httpMethod = "GET"

  let session = URLSession.shared
  let dataTask = session.dataTask(with: request as URLRequest, completionHandler: { (data, response, error) -> Void in
    if (error != nil) {
        print(error)
    } else {
        let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse
        print(httpResponse)
    }
  })

  dataTask.resume()
}
```

Let us now add the callback for handling a notification. We're not going to do anything special other than print it to the console.

```[swift]
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) {
    print("** received notification: \(userInfo)")
}
```

If you have the app running with the debugger attached, you would see the printed message when a notification is received. We don't need to do anything else as the operating system will handle the generic messages we see on the lock screen. However, if the app is in the foreground you may want to use this method to show an alert to the user.

We need to register the user now. Paste the code below inside the @didFinishLaunchingWithOptions()@ method where we request notifications from the user if possible. We setup our connection to ably and also reactivate AblyPush depending on our connection to Ably.

```[swift]
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    print("** hello")

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options:[.badge, .alert, .sound]) { (granted, err) in
        DispatchQueue.main.async() {
            UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            print("** after registerForRemoteNotifications")
        }
    }

    self.realtime = self.getAblyRealtime()

    // Deactivating may be necessary as the deployed app might have state inconsistent with the Ably app
    // print("** De-activating Ably push")
    // self.realtime.push.deactivate()

    self.realtime.connection.on { (stateChange) in
        print("** connection state change: \(String(describing: stateChange))")
    }

    self.realtime.connection.on(ARTRealtimeConnectionEvent.connected) { (stateChange) in
        print("** connected, resetting Ably push")
        self.realtime.push.deactivate()
    }

    return true
}
```

Finally, make the app delegate conform to @ARTPushRegistererDelegate@ so that we can receive our callbacks.

```[swift]
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, ARTPushRegistererDelegate {
```
