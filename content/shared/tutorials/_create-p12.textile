h3. Creating an App ID

Before you can configure your devices to receive push notifications, you must first enable push in your app by either editing your current iOS App ID or creating a new one. This step will show you how to create a new App ID in your Apple developer portal with the correct certificates and services enabled.  

Login to your "Apple developer account":https://developer.apple.com and click on "Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles". Now, select "App IDs" tab from side menu and create a new App ID using the plus button, as shown below.

Note: If you have already created an App ID for your app, you can skip this step. Instead you can simply edit your current App ID and enable Push Notifications.

</a>

Next, specify the name of your app and Bundle ID (yours will have to be different but it should look something like the following)

</a>

Now, select Push Notifications from the list of app services and click on "Continue".

</a>

Finally click on "Register", then "Done" to complete the app registration step.

h3. Generating a certificate from Keychain access

Launch the Keychain Access application in your Mac OS X and select:

Keychain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority

After you reach the screen shown below, enter your email address and check the "Saved to disk" option. Click continue and select a location on your drive to save the certificate to.

h3. Generating a development certificate

To generate a development certificate, follow the steps below:

* Return to your Apple developer account.
* Select your newly created App ID from the "App ID's" list and click on "Edit".
* Scroll down to the Push notifications and click on "Create Certificate".

</a>

On the next screen click continue as you have already completed that step. Now you'll need to upload the signing certificate that we earlier saved to our disk. After that's done, click on "Continue".

  <img src="/images/tutorials/push-ios/ios-push-upload-signing-cert.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Upload signing certificate">
</a>

This will create a new downloadable Push certificate with a validity of one year. Go ahead and download it.

</a>

h3. Generating the APNS P12

Double click on your newly downloaded certificate to add it to your Keychan access. Open the Keychain access application and right click on the certificate with the bundle ID we defined earlier, then select the export option from the drop-down menu.

</a>

Give your new certificate a name and make sure that the ".p12" option is selected and click save. On the next screen you can setup a password for this certificate. You may also be asked to supply your computer password.
