The Ably asset tracking solution provides a way to track multiple assets in realtime. An asset is any object that moves geographically, and whose position needs to be monitored. The asset tracking solution is powered by the Ably realtime network, the Ably Asset Tracking SDKs, and the Mapbox Navigation SDK with location enhancement.

The Ably asset tracking solution provides two SDKs:

* Publisher SDK - for embedding in apps on the asset to be tracked.
* Subscriber SDK - for embedding in apps that want to observe the asset being tracked.

As Ably is used as the underlying transport, you have direct access to your data and can use Ably integrations for a wide range of applications, in addition to direct realtime subscriptions. Examples include: 

* Passing data to a third-party service.
* Persistence of data to a database for later retrieval.

As the asset being tracked moves, it publishes its position through the app to an Ably channel. Any subscribers to the channel can then receive positional information, which can be displayed on a detailed map.

The following diagram provides an overview of an asset tracking use case:

In a typical asset tracking scenario the key participants are:

- asset (trackable) := Item that the customer wants to track such as driver, vehicle, container, and so on. This also known as a @Trackable@ in the SDKs.
- driver := Person driving the asset physically, or entity controlling the asset programatically.
- customer := Entity that uses the Ably Asset Tracking SDKs to build their product to solve the asset tracking problem for their users.
- end user := Person that uses the product built by the customer and uses the asset tracking capabilities.

Each asset being tracked must have a @trackableId@, and this must be globally unique within an Ably asset tracking account.

The Ably Asset Tracking SDKs also allow for various battery optimization scenarios, so frequency of updates can be modified based on various parameters such as distance to destination, subscriber status, map zoom level, and existing battery levels.

h2(#battery-optimization). Battery optimization scenarios

One of the biggest challenges in asset tracking is combining high resolution of updates with low battery consumption on the asset tracking device. For example, in a delivery tracking use case you may want your users to have a smooth and realtime visualization of where their delivery is on the map, but at the same time sending realtime locations from the driver's device frequently will rapidly drain its battery.

There are two key factors that impact asset tracking device battery usage:

1. GPS sensor - obtaining location of the asset.
2. Networking - sending location updates over network.

It is hard to reduce the battery consumption of the GPS sensor in some situations, such as when the device is being used for navigation at the same time as tracking an asset. However, it is possible to adjust the networking aspect of resolution.

The following scenarios are examples of how update resolution can be changed depending on the state of the asset and subscribers:

* Updates can be sent to the subscriber more often when asset is closer to destination.
* Updates don't need to happen as often when the user of the subscribing SDK is not observing the location of the asset, for example, the user of delivery app is not checking the app for the driver's location.
* Different subscribers may have different preferences regarding the resolution of location updates.
* When the driver's battery is running low, location updates can happen with lower frequency.

Using the approaches similar to these, an optimal resolution of updates can be identified, which provides a good user experience when it is needed, such as when the driver is close to the destination, and the user is observing the location of the driver in the app. This approach also reduces battery usage when possible, for example when the driver is far from the destination and the user is not observing location updates.

While developers can create their own code to implement battery optimization logic, Ably also provides a set of default constraints and policies, which are suitable for common use cases.

h2(#resolution). Resolution

Resolution governs how often to sample locations, at what level of positional accuracy, and how often to send updates to subscribers.

@Resolution@ is made up of:

- @Accuracy@ := The general priority for accuracy of location updates, used to govern any trade-off between power usage and positional accuracy. The highest positional accuracy will be achieved by specifying @Accuracy.MAXIMUM@, but at the expense of significantly increased power usage. Conversely, the lowest power usage will be achieved by specifying @Accuracy.MINIMUM@ but at the expense of significantly decreased positional accuracy.
- @desiredInterval@ := Desired time between updates, in milliseconds. Lowering this value increases the temporal resolution. Location updates whose timestamp differs from the last captured update timestamp by less that this value are to be filtered out. Used to govern the frequency of updates requested from the underlying location provider, as well as the frequency of messages broadcast to subscribers.
- @minimumDisplacement@ := Minimum positional granularity required, in metres. Lowering this value increases the spatial resolution. Location updates whose position differs from the last known position by a distance smaller than this value are to be filtered out. Used to configure the underlying location provider, as well as to filter the broadcast of updates to subscribers.

h2(#resolution-set). Resolution set

A resolution set, is a set of resolutions that must be provided by the app in order to inform the resolution policy. While developers can define their own resolution sets, Ably also provides a default resolution set that can be used for common use cases.

h3(#default-resolution-set). Default resolution set

The @DefaultResolutionSet@ is the set of resolutions which must be defined in order to satisfy the "default resolution constraints":#default-resolution-constraints. These are required in order to inform the "default resolution policy":#default-resolution-policy.

For the @DefaultResolutionSet@ the following resolutions are expected to be included:

- @farWithoutSubscriber@ := The resolution to select if above the "@proximityThreshold@":#default-resolution-constraints), with no subscribers.
- @farWithSubscriber@ := The resolution to select if above the "@proximityThreshold@":#default-resolution-constraints), with one or more subscribers.
- @nearWithoutSubscriber@ := The resolution to select if below the "@proximityThreshold@":#default-resolution-constraints), with no subscribers.
- @nearWithSubscriber@ := The resolution to select if below the "@proximityThreshold@":#default-resolution-constraints), with one or more subscribers.

h2(#resolution-constraints). Resolution constraints

Resolution constraints specify the thresholds and corresponding logical mappings for tracking @Resolution@s that are required by the default @ResolutionPolicy@, which can be adopted by @Publisher@ instances. While developers can define their own resolution constraints, Ably also provides default resolution constraints that can be used for common use cases.

h3(#default-resolution-constraints). Default resolution constraints

The Ably-provided default resolution constraints consist of:

- @DefaultResolutionSet@ := The set of resolutions which must be defined in order to populate the @DefaultResolutionConstraints@.
- @DefaultProximity@ := This is a distance to destination at which resolution of updates is increased to improve user experience.
- @batteryLevelThreshold@ := This is a level of battery on the device that runs Publishing SDK that is considered low. When the battery level falls below this, the resolution of updates is reduced. Default value: 10%. In the range 0.0f (no battery) to 100.0f (full battery).
- @lowBatteryMultiplier@ := The multipler to be applied to the interval when the battery level is below @batteryLevelThreshold@.

The following example shows how the default resolution constraints are populated:

```[android]
// Prepare Resolution Constraints for an asset that will be used in the Resolution Policy
val exampleConstraints = DefaultResolutionConstraints(
    DefaultResolutionSet( // this constructor provides one Resolution for all states
        Resolution(
            accuracy = Accuracy.BALANCED,
            desiredInterval = 1000L,
            minimumDisplacement = 1.0
        )
    ),
    proximityThreshold = DefaultProximity(spatial = 1.0),
    batteryLevelThreshold = 10.0f,
    lowBatteryMultiplier = 2.0f
)
```

h2(#resolution-policy). Resolution policy

Resolution policy defines the strategy by which the various @ResolutionRequests@ and preferences are translated by @Publisher@ instances into a target @Resolution@.

As different use cases have different requirements for battery optimization, Ably Asset Tracking SDKs provide a flexible @ResolutionPolicy@ interface, that allows SDK users to provide their own implementation of resolution optimization logic. Ably also provides a "default resolution policy":#default-resolution-policy, which is suitable for common use cases.

h3(#default-resolution-policy). Default resolution policy

Ably Asset Tracking SDKs come with a @DefaultResolutionPolicy@ implementation provided out of the box, which is suitable for common use cases.

Each @Trackable@ added to the @Publisher@ has a destination and set of @ResolutionConstraints@. Ably provides a set of "default resolution constraints":#default-resolution-constraints, @DefaultResolutionContraints@.

When the SDK is running, on each change of the device or trackable status, the @ResolutionPolicy@ recalculates which resolution should be applied. Example changes include: 

* Subscribers added or removed from the list of subscribers.
* Battery or proximity threshold hit.
* Subscriber closes app.

The following logic is used:

1. When comparing resolutions, the more precise resolution is always selected.
2. The most precise resolution is selected from the resolutions requested by subscribers.
3. Then, based on the @ResolutionSet@ provided, and also the state of the thresholds, the correct @Resolution@ is identified from the set. This resolution is then compared with the one from previous step, and the more precise one is selected.
4. The low battery multiplier is applied if needed.
