title: Protocol Adapters
meta_description: "Clients can use the Ably network using SSE and MQTT protocol adapters. This is especially useful where an Ably Client Library SDK is not available for your language of choice, or where platform resource constraints prohibit use of a Client Library SDK."

While the recommended method for connecting to Ably is through the use of the Ably Client Library SDKs, there are certain situation where this is not possible, due to lack of platform support, or platform resource constraints. In this situation, certain clients may be supported though the use of Ably protocol adapters. There are two protocol adapters in this section of the documentation:

1. MQTT
2. SSE

Each of these will be described in the following sections.

h2(#mqtt). MQTT

MQTT protocol adapter provides an interface between an MQTT client and Ably. MQTT clients can subscribe and publish to Ably channels. Any client that supports MQTT can therefore leverage Ably's realtime network, with some constraints. 

For more information on Ably's MQTT protocol adapter see the "MQTT documentation":/mqtt.

h2(#sse). SSE

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a functionality built into certain browsers. The Ably SSE protocol allows the browser to subscribe to a realtime stream of events from an Ably channel. In addition to the SSE endpoint, Ably also provides a raw HTTP streaming endpoint. 

For more information on Ably's SSE protocol adapter see the "SSE documentation":/sse.
