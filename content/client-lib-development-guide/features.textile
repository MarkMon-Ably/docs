This document outlines the complete feature set of both the REST and Realtime client libraries. It is expected that every client library developer refers to this document to ensure that their client library provides the same API and features as the existing Ably client libraries. In addition to this, it is essential that there is test coverage over all of the features described below. As an example, see the Ruby library "test specification and coverage":https://github.com/ably/ably-ruby/blob/main/SPEC.md generated from the test suite.

We recommend you use the "IDL (Interface Definition Language)":#idl and refer to other existing libraries that adhere to this spec as a reference when reviewing how the API has been implemented.

The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" (whether lowercased or uppercased) in this document are to be interpreted as described in "RFC 2119":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119 .

__Please note we maintain a separate Google Sheet that keeps track of which features are implemented and matching test coverage for each client library. If you intend to work on an Ably client library, please "contact us":https://ably.com/contact for access to this Google Sheet as it is useful as a reference and also needs to be kept up to date__

h2(#realtime). Realtime client library features

The Ably Realtime client libraries establish and maintain a persistent connection to Ably and provide methods to publish and subscribe to messages over a low latency realtime connection.

The Realtime library is a super-set of the REST library and as such all Realtime libraries provide the functionality available in the REST library in addition to Realtime-specific features.

The threading and/or asynchronous model for each realtime library will vary by language and it is therefore up to the developer to decide on the best approach for each given client library. For example, Node.js and Ruby (EventMachine) use a similar callback single threaded evented approach that ensures all public methods are non-blocking. Java and .NET use a threaded model whereby the @Connection@ runs in its own thread. Go makes extensive use of goroutines and channels.

h2(#idl). Interface Definition

The following bespoke IDL (Interface Definition Language) describes the types and classes present in the REST and Realtime client libraries.

Please note the following conventions:

* Types are capitalized
* Attribute and method names are lowercase
* Attributes are denoted as @attributeName: Type@
* Instance methods are denoted as @methodName(argName: Type, argName: Type) -> ReturnType@ (@ReturnType@ may be omitted)
* Callback functions / closures are denoted as @(argName: Type, argName: Type) -> ReturnType@ (@ReturnType@ is usually omitted)
* Values produced by I/O (e.g. a request) are prefixed with @=> io@. In some platforms (JS) those values are passed as arguments to a callback argument, instead of being returned. I/O always can fail, but how do they fail is undefined in the spec, so it's also undefined here
* Enums are denoted as @.A | .B | .C@
* @Type?@ denotes a nullable type
* @[Type: Othertype]@ denotes a map, hash or equivalent, or (if idiomatic) a list of 2-tuples.
* @Type default value@ denotes that the thing being annotated with @Type@ has @value@ as default. @Type api-default value@ denotes that the Ably server API uses those defaults and therefore it is unnecessary for the client library to send these default values to the API
* Class fields (as opposed to instance fields) are prefixed with a @+@
* @Duration@ and @Time@ types are typically represented as milliseconds since the epoch. Where needed, a more idiomatic language specific duration may be used such as @seconds@ or @Time@ respectively for Ruby
* @Data@ is a message payload type, see "RSL4a":#RSL4a for a list of supported payload types
* @Stringifiable@ is a type used for unknown configuration parameters that need to be coerced to strings when used, see "RTC1f":#RTC1f for definition
* @JSONObject@ and @JSONArray@ denote any type or interface in the target language that represents an "RFC4627":https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt @object@ or @array@ value respectively. Such types serialize to, and may be deserialized from, the corresponding JSON text. In the specification text above, values of these types are collectively referred to as "JSON-encodable".

Each type, method, and attribute is labelled with the name of one or more clauses from the preceding feature spec. An asterisk is used as a wildcard to mean all clauses with a given prefix.
