h2(#setup-ably-account). Step 1 - Create an Ably app and API key

To follow this tutorial, you will need an Ably account. "Sign up for a free account":https://ably.com/signup if you don't already have one.

Access to the "Ably global messaging platform":https://ably.com/platform requires an "API key":/glossary#api-key for authentication. An API key exists within the context of an "Ably application":/glossary#apps and each application can have multiple API keys so that you can assign different "capabilities":/glossary#capability and manage access to "channels":/glossary#channels and "queues":/glossary#queues.

You can either create a new application for this tutorial, or use an existing one.

To *create a new application* and generate an API key:

# "Log in to your Ably account dashboard":https://ably.com/login
# Click the "Create New App" button
# Give it a name and click "Create app"
# Copy your private API key and store it somewhere. You will need it for this tutorial.

To *use an existing application* and API key:

# Select an application from "Your apps" in the dashboard
# In the API keys tab, choose an API key to use for this tutorial. The default "Root" API key has full access to capabilities and channels. 
# Copy the Root API key and store it somewhere. You will need it for this tutorial.
